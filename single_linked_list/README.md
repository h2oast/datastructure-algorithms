# Reverse a single linked list
  This is a test from an interview of me, during the interview I was requested
  to implement a function to reverse a singlely linked list. The first time,
  I write a wrong code, the interviewer remind me it is wrong. I tried a little
  hard later, and finally give my answer to him. So I put it here, hope this
  would remind myself never stop coding, and keep thinking deeply.

  The 'reverse' function is the answer, other code is mainly for testing its
  correctness.
